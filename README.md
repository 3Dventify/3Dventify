# 3Dventify Open Source Project

**Empowering Children and Young Women Through 3D-Printed Assistive Devices**

---

## 🌍 About the Project

3Dventify is a social impact startup based in Kenya focused on bridging gaps in healthcare and inclusion through **affordable, locally manufactured assistive devices**. Using **FDM 3D printing**, we design and prototype functional solutions like:

- **Ankle-Foot Orthoses (AFOs)** for children with gait abnormalities  
- **Assistive writing aids** for children with motor disabilities  
- **Below-elbow prosthetic hand models** for those with amputations  

Our aim is to make these devices accessible in **low-resource settings** while empowering **young women** through skill-building in tech-driven manufacturing.
